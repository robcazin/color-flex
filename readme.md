# üé® ColorFlex: Custom Pattern Design App

ColorFlex is a browser-based tool for visualizing and customizing wallpaper and pattern-based surfaces using real Sherwin-Williams color codes. The app loads curated pattern collections and allows users to preview how designs look across mockups and coordinates, including walls and furniture.

## üöß Known Issues

- **Pattern Preview not rendering**: Currently, only a solid background appears in the preview. Likely due to incorrect `scaleFactor` application or asset masking issues.
- **Color input only affects room mockup**: Pattern canvas ignores selected user colors until scale changes.
- **Shadow logic bug**: Some patterns incorrectly add or misplace shadow layers.
- **Wall panels**: Patterns flagged as wall panels do not initialize exclusive wall inputs.
- **Pattern scaling**: Default view appears zoomed-in, and buttons apply scale but progressively degrade quality.
- **Asset offsets**: Some patterns align incorrectly depending on their tiling and `tintWhite` flags.
